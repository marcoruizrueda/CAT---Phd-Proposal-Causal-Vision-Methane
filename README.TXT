The Thesis-MSC LaTeX template can be used for Instituto Superior Técnico Master of Science thesis of DEI (or other departments), as it follows the regulations published by the Scientific Council of IST.

To start using, just open and modify your data in the following files:

=====================================================================================
1. Thesis-MSc-Preamble_commands.tex
=====================================================================================
Select the ‘main’ language of your thesis in the line that loads the package ‘babel’:
line.22
	\usepackage[main=english,portuguese]{babel}	
	or 
	\usepackage[english,main=portuguese]{babel}
	
The thesis document will then "auto-magically" modify all the adequate keywords, titles, captions, etc. according to the selected language.

Later, you may modify parameters or include other LaTeX packages if deemed necessary.

To deliver a PDF version without annotations/todonotes and Track Changes, you need to modify the options as follows:

For TODO Notes, the following lines:
line.120/121
    % use the line with the 'disable' option for the TODO Notes
    \usepackage[textwidth=2cm, textsize=small, disable]{todonotes}
 
For Track Changes, the following lines: 
line.129/130
    % use the line with the 'final' option for the Track Changes
    \usepackage[authormarkup=superscript,authormarkuptext=id,markup=underlined,ulem={ULforem,normalbf},final]{changes}

=====================================================================================
2. Thesis-MSc-Front_Cover.tex
=====================================================================================
In this document insert your data (your full name, thesis titles, supervisors names, date, degree, etc.):

	\title{}
	\subtitle{}
	\author{}
	\degree{}
	\supervisor{}
	\othersupervisor{}
	\date{}

Staring at line 31 you can select /or change) the official name of the course/degree. Please chose portuguese or english line, depending if the document is written in portuguese or in english, respectiveley.

For Tracking changes, you can also replace the id of the collaborators, in the lines 64-66:

    \definechangesauthor[color=colorname]{id}

For a DRAFT version of the thesis (before examination) select (comment/uncomment) the following command to the value ‘false’ (in lines 63/64):

	\finalthesis{false}

If it is for the final version (approved after examination) then select (comment/uncomment) the command to the value ‘true’ (in lines 72/73):

	\finalthesis{true}

and include the full names of all the members of the Examination Committee (except the Supervisor), as officially approved:

	\chairperson{} (the President of the Committee, after approval)
	\vogalone{} (it is, normally, the only committee member, i.e., the main Examiner)
	\vogaltwo{} (normally not used)
	\vogalthree{} (normally not used)
=====================================================================================
3. The Content
=====================================================================================
The content of your thesis will be written in the documents that are in folder ‘Chapters’.
Do not modify the ‘header’ in all those documents, except the name of the document as it contains compilation directives.
 
If you need to add more Chapters, just create new .tex documents and add the header.
If you do not need that many Chapters in your thesis, just comment the lines in the main document:

  	‘Thesis-MSc-Main_Document.tex’

For example, if you do not need a 6th Chapter, comment the following lines:

	%Chapter 6
	\input{./Chapters/Thesis-MSc-Chapter_6.tex}
	% If Printing on DOUBLE SIDED pages, the second page should be white.
	% Otherwise, comment the following command:
	\cleardoublepage

=====================================================================================
4. Thesis-MSc-Bibliography.bib
=====================================================================================
This file is the default Bibliography database. 
If you are using some Reference Manager, such as Zotero [zotero.org] (highly recommended), or Bibdesk, you can export your Library into a "Bibtex" .bib file.
You may then opt for one of these methods:
a. replace the content of Thesis-MSc-Bibliography.bib with the content of the exported file (generated by the Reference Manager).
b. upload the the exported file (generated by the Reference Manager) and modify the corresponding line in in the main document ‘Thesis-MSc-Main_Document.tex’ to reflect the filename, for example for a file with name "thesisbiblio.bib":
    replace this line:
	\bibliography{./Thesis-MSc-Bibliography}
    with this:
	\bibliography{./thesisbiblio}

=====================================================================================
5. Thesis Cover Logo/Picture
=====================================================================================
If you do not want a Thesis Logo (picture) in the cover just comment line 18 of 'Thesis-MSc-Front_Cover.tex'

=====================================================================================
6. Page Numbering
=====================================================================================
If you want to have page numbers at the right/left (instead of Centered) of the page footer, then go to section "% Choose the positioning of the Page Number" at lines 295 of the 'Thesis-MSc-Preamble_commands.tex' and select the option.

=====================================================================================
7. Acronyms and Abbreviations
=====================================================================================
The template  includes a feature to simplify and automate the use of Acronyms and Abbreviations as well as print a Table of the ones used in the document.
The rule for using Acronyms, is to have them defined in the text on first use, and then just invoke the acronym.
The Acronyms package does precisely that, i.e., allows you to use command to invoke the Acronym and the tool just "knows" if is is the first time or not, so that either prints the extended meaning or just the Acronym.

Acronyms are defined in the file  "Thesis-MSc-Acronyms.tex" with command \acro{ }{ }.

In the text you can invoke the Acronym definitions with the command \ac{ }, or \acp{ } for plural.
There are examples in the template for you to see how it is done.

=====================================================================================
8. Glossary, Terms and Symbols
=====================================================================================
The template includes (optionally) a Glossary package that allow you to create List of Terms (a Glossary), as well as a List of Symbols used, that are printed in the Indexes pages, before the main content.
Glossary and Symbol "Entries" are defined in the file  "Thesis-MSc-Glossary.tex" with command \newglossaryentry{ }.

In the text you can invoke the Glossary or Symbol entries with the command \gls{ }.
There are examples in the template for you to see how it is done.

In case you do not use Symbology and/or Glossaries, then just comment the lines 137, 139 and 141, and/or 172, 174 and 176, respectively.
=====================================================================================
9. Automatic naming of floats (Figures, Tables, etc.), and document parts (Chapters, Sections, etc.)
=====================================================================================
The template includes a feature to simplify and automate the invocation of the correct "name" of floats, such as Figures and Tables or parts of the document.

For this to work you just need to add a \label{} with a unique name to the item.
For parts of the document (Chapters, Sections, etc.) the label is added after the command that starts each part.
For example, if you have a Section:

\section{Title the Section One}\label{sec:one}
or if you have a Figure, insert the label after the caption:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/cashed5}
    \caption{Ecosystem}
    \label{fig:cashed}
\end{figure}

In the text you can then invoke the item with the command \Cref{fig:cashed}, in the case of the Figure or \Cref{sec:one} in the case of a Section, etc..
There are examples in the template for you to see how it is done.

=====================================================================================
10. Other Features
=====================================================================================
The Template also includes examples of several other features, such as "TODO NOTES", "TRACK CHANGES", use of "Table Generators" to allow creating quite complex tables and then just paste the code in the document, "Snippets of Code" with syntax highlighting, and Algorithms pseudo-code constructs.
